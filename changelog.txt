Changelog 9/27/2021:
- Fixed a bug where the User interface would lag for a long time when "Set All to High Quality" or LQ was clicked.
- Fixed a bug where the program would calculate extremely high sharpness values when images contain few feature points.
- Improved autocategorize with respect to exposure by implementing a new system that searches for outliers for exposure assignment
	based on standard deviation and mean values rather than a percentage of all photos. This was in response to a beta tester suggestion.
- Fixed a bug where standard deviation based exposure assignment would sometimes classify an entire group of near-identical images as
	Low Quality as the standard deviation was near-zero.
- Fixed a bug where the program would crash if it tries to create a folder with invalid characters.

Chagelog 9/25/21:
- Patched an issue where reading a MagickImage did not occur properly even on fallback due to memory issues by making it try 10 more times before crashing the program.
- Implemnted AI Face Detection (Experimental)
- Implemented DoveEye Installer and fixed relevant bugs (Now works!)
- Fixed a bug where not selecting a directory would send photos into the root folder of the exe file LOL

NOTE: Program is formally ready for a CLOSED BETA TEST.


Known Issues:
- MainWindow does not close when analysis complete
- MAJOR: program UI does not scale properly - is currently fixed to whatever it is right now.
- Enlarged View not implemented yet
- Sharpness is currently text
- Image Analysis Options not implemented yet (PARTLY FIXED)
- When assigning images, it is probably best to keep x% of each group, x% of all images, or, find the largest drop in sharpness and place the cutoff there.
