KNOWN ISSUES:
1) Merge Down does not work properly in quickRegroup
2) GM looks ugly
3) Massive Memory Issues still occur (FIXED MAYBE)
4) Sharpness Detection algorithm performing slowly (FIXED)
5) Grouping Detection Fails when little image information is provided. (CHANGE TO FALLBACK ALGORITHM???)
6) Grouping human prompts seem to be too frequent?
7) (POTENTIAL) Sharpness Detection algorithm may result in significantly different numbers based on size?? (FIXED)
8) (POTENTIAL) Image analysis might not default to raw format
9) Sharpness Analysis uses 1500px, rather than 1/4 of image width/etc.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
1) Entire Finalize system

Grouping manager finishing:
1) get rid of grouping management buttons (replaced with quickregroup)
2) Implement Large Thumbnail View
3) Implement Enlarged View + EXIF data??
4) Implement some way to categorize images - keep it as a listbox for now I guess?
5) Textbox - try seeing if it can be a listboxable textbox
6) Scrolling - try to see if you can interrupt mousescroll events and send it to the listbox
7) background etc. clean it up a bit


then need to implement help videos or something, donation page, thats all!

FUTURE RELEASES:
1) Image Analysis Options (backend somewhat supports this already)
	image thumbnail quality
	sharpness area - facial, center, full, image subject detection
	prompt threshold options?



user interface design

CURRENT:
- find some solution to the sharpnessanalysis issue:
	- takes too much time
	possible solutions
		-move it to the analysis
		-make it analyze off of the thumbnail (probably best?)
- some alternative way to store the image in memory please?? not a bitmap

Best thing might be to just....
Abandon the sharpness analysis customization option entirely for beta release - let it autoassign sharpness area and calculate sharpness based on that area
and if that doesn't work, default to image center or whole image
move the image sharpness analysis to the initial doveeyeimage constructor
sortbysharpness before even pushing the thing to gmui and opening the new window.
evaluate sharpenss based on a thumbnail, chose a resize option that doesn't have as much noise as currently seen.
potentially use a thumbnail of 40% size, then downscale it again to 20% size for memory usage.



probably need to switch this whole project over to libraw eventually: https://github.com/laheller/SharpLibraw





things
- disable auto sharpness area updating
- need to make bitmapimage garbage become a thing because windows is questionable

grouping manager window
- shows groupings 
- shows sharpness area overtop of groupings
- allows sharpness area to change around 
- button to compute and sort by sharpness vs sort by image index
- groups can be labelled with a textbox at the top. 
- Selecting a group updates information on the side allowing sharpness area to change if necessary
- drag/drop likely the best way to manage individual images
- right click menu probably the best way to split images
- each image has a drop-down category where you can chose "Best" or "Rest"

finish analysis button 
- move into folders by group option
- move into folders by best/worst option
- delete worst images option with 50 confirmation messageboxes
